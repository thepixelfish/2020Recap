        <h1><center>Here's What I made in 2020!</center></h1>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://luketurner.dev/better-rods-reviews/">Better Rod's Reviews</a> was my solution to the very bad review system on the Rod's website. Luckily they fixed it a few weeks ago!</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/thepixelfish/kiss-marry-avoid">Kiss Marry Avoid</a> Was a self explanatory discord bot I made earlier in the year. Just install, load it up with photos, and enjoy the classic elementary school game.</li>
            <li>I wrote a <a href="https://luketurner.dev/journal/">Quarantine Journal</a> for the first few months of quarantine. It's pretty simple and sometimes too emotional.</li>
            <li>I started reading <a href="https://luketurner.dev/onepiece/">One Piece!</a> I tried to review each volume but failed. I'll get back to it. Can't wait for chapter 1000!</li>
            <li><a href="https://luketurner.dev/time/">Time</a> is a world clock with the current times of every time zone my friends live in. There is also a pomodoro on it for work.</li>
            <li>In 2018 I made a site that displays manga panels. It was kinda dumb so I remade it. <a href="https://luketurner.dev/mangaproject/">Here it is.</a> I'll add more to it eventually!</li>
            <li>I made a few mixtapes this year too. You can find them <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pixelfish">here!</a></li>
